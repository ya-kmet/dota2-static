# Dota2::Static

This gem provides Dota 2 ingame static data and images for Rails applications.

All data are collected using Dotabuff repositories [d2vpk](https://github.com/dotabuff/d2vpk) and
[dota-econ-leagues](https://github.com/dotabuff/dota-econ-leagues) and updated automatically shortly after dotabuff
commits changes. All images are downloaded from Steam CDNs, except leagues images that are taken from Dota 2 client
files.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dota2-static', :git => 'git@github.com:godjo/dota2-static.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
